Hi,

This is my project for the GameDesign. You can find all sources and a exe file "Jeu_GameDesign.exe" to launch the game.

Rules of the game:

You are a Sphere and you need to pick up all cubes on the map to finish the level. You have to dodge the hole and the red color.
You can move the Sphere with the directionnal arrow.

New is this game:

All cubes have a Bonus or a Malus.
Bonus: Speed +, Tp up
Malus: Speed -, Tp back, TP before
Useless: Change Color

This bonus or malus are completly random. The player can't know the function of which cubes.
We can find so many possibility of levels with this. But for this project only one level done.

I think i will continue this game. For finish totally the concept and the gamedesign of this one.

ENJOY!! Try to finish the level!! :D
